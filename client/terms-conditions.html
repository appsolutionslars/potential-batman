							Below are the general terms and conditions for consulting services rendered by appSolutions a|s, hereinafter called 'appSolutions'.
						</p>
						<p>
							appSolutions reserves the right to change these Terms and Conditions at any time. Such changes will not take effect during an already agreed upon contract period with a customer,unless the customer is notified of the changes in writing.
						</p>

						<h4>Time estimates</h4>
						<p>
							Unless otherwise specified, all indications of time for an activity are estimates. These estimates are considered accurate at the time of writing. In situations, where the estimated times are incorrect, customers will be invoiced for the actual time spent,
							unless otherwise indicated or agreed upon beforehand.
						</p>
						<p>
							Should it be necessary to spend more time than estimated on any given activity, appSolutions will give notice to the customer as soon as possible. The estimated time will not be exceeded unless agreed upon with the customer beforehand.
						</p>
						<p>
							In each case both the customer and appSolutions must agree on the status of the task at the time of the extension. This agreement must also include an estimate of the extra time needed to complete the task.
						</p>

						<h4>Working hours</h4>
						<p>
							Times indicated in days assume an 8-hour working day. When actual time spent on activities is worked out, this will be done in hours. The only exception is, if an agreement has been made for a fixed daily fee. In such cases actual work done will be calculated
							in days or part thereof using an 8-hour day as the reference.
						</p>
						<p>
							Activities performed during Danish national holidays or during weekends will be surcharged with an additional 100%. The weekend commences at 17:00 Friday evening. Activities that fall under this category will not be undertaken by appSolutions without
							a clear written agreement between appSolutions and the customer.
						</p>
						<p>
							Should it be required that certain activities are performed outside normal working hours (09:00 – 17:00), there will be an additional charge of 50% of the agreed hourly fee.
						</p>

						<h4>Expenses</h4>
						<p>
							All expenses incurred for travelling, accommodation and meals whilst visiting customers, their end-users or in any other way on behalf of the customer, will be invoiced to the customer. This includes travelling to and from the customer’s site and alternate
							locations specified by the customer.
						</p>
						<p>
							Expenses incurred to purchase software, hardware or other goods on behalf of the customer will also be invoiced to the customer.

						<p>
							Expenses incurred as a result of cancellations by the customer after an agreement has been entered into will be invoiced in full to the customer. This includes, but is not limited to, non-refundable airline tickets that have been purchased by appSolutions
							for the purpose of travelling to a destination stated in the agreement between appSolutions and the customer.
						</p>
						<p>
							Intercontinental flights with a total travel time of over 12 hours each way will be booked as Business Class tickets. The alternative to this is the use of economy class tickets with an additional charge for travel time of 50% of the agreed on-site consulting
							rate.
						</p>

						<h4>Confidentiality</h4>
						<p>
							appSolutions may have possession of and/or access to Confidential Information of its customers. appSolutions will hold all such Confidential Information in strict confidence and shall use such Confidential Information only for the purposes of the agreed
							activities. Furthermore, appSolutions will not otherwise use or disclose to third parties any such Confidential Information.
						</p>

						<h4>Termination of Agreement</h4>
						<p>
							In case of termination of an Agreement prior to its expiration, appSolutions shall be paid for services rendered and reimbursable expenses up to the date of such termination and not thereafter. Payment upon termination will be accepted by appSolutions
							as full satisfaction of any and all claims and demands in connection with the Agreement. Such termination will only be accepted in writing.
						</p>
						<p>
							Agreements that are terminated by the customer less than one full week prior to commencement will be invoiced at 50% of the value of agreement, unless otherwise confirmed in writing at the time of signing and agreement for services.
						</p>

						<h4>Postponement of Agreement</h4>
						<p>
							Agreements that are postponed to commence or be completed at a later date than initially agreed upon are not considered terminated.
						</p>

							However, costs incurred for non-refundable travel or other expenses will be charged in full to the customer upon postponement.
						</p>

						<h4>Performance of Services</h4>
						<p>
							appSolutions shall perform all services in a professional and expeditious manner and warrants that its services will be of a professional quality.
